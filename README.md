# Data Cleaning Using Python
* I used AI generated dataset to practice using Python for data cleaning/ analysis. The challenges being solved were;*
## 1.The Name Cleanup (Consistency):
-	Fix Product column & clear the whitespaces.
- Fix Sales_Rep. You have 'John Doe' and 'john doe', plus 'Jane Smith' and 'J. Smith.
- Make sure there are only 3 unique reps: John Doe, Jane Smith, and Bob Brown.
##  2.The Math Logic (Finance):
- Fill missing Unit_Price values with the median price of that specific product.
-	Fill missing Discount_Applied with 0.0.
##  3.The Revenue Formula:
- Create a column Gross_Sales & calculate the gross sales.
- Create a column Net_Revenue & calculate the net revenue.
  ## 4.The "Power BI" Prep (Aggregation):
-	In Power BI, we often want to see "Performance by Person."
-	Create a new summary DataFrame called rep_performance that shows the Total Net_Revenue for each Sales_Rep.
  ## 5.Quality Check:
-	Check how many unique products and sales_reps you have left. If Sales_Rep is more than 3, you still have cleaning to do!
