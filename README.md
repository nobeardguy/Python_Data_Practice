# Data Cleaning Using Python
* I used AI generated dataset to practice using Python for data cleaning/ analysis. The challenges being solved were;*
## The Name Cleanup (Consistency):
1.	Fix Product column. Clear the whitespaces.
2.Fix Sales_Rep. You have 'John Doe' and 'john doe', plus 'Jane Smith' and 'J. Smith. Make sure there are only 3 unique reps: John Doe, Jane Smith, and Bob Brown.
##  The Math Logic (Finance):
1. Fill missing Unit_Price values with the median price of that specific product.
2.	Fill missing Discount_Applied with 0.0.
•  The Revenue Formula:
•	Create a column Gross_Sales.
•	Create a column Net_Revenue.
•  The "Power BI" Prep (Aggregation):
•	In Power BI, we often want to see "Performance by Person."
•	Create a new summary DataFrame called rep_performance that shows the Total Net_Revenue for each Sales_Rep.
•  Quality Check:
•	Check how many unique products and sales_reps you have left. If Sales_Rep is more than 3, you still have cleaning to do!
